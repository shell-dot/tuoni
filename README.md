## Installation

Installer will try to install docker version 25.0.0 or greater

```bash
wget  -O - https://tuoni.sh | bash
cd tuoni
```
or if you prefer curl
```
curl https://tuoni.sh | bash
cd tuoni
```

---

If you prefer to install without any user input, add SILENT=1 to the command line
```
export SILENT=1; curl https://tuoni.sh | bash
```
additional variables available and their defaults:
- TUONI_USERNAME=tuoni
- TUONI_PASSWORD=autogenerated
- TUONI_DOCKER_IPV6_ENABLED=false

If you run the install again, it will try to update tuoni. SILENT=1 will skip prompts, as mentioned before.

For automation purposes, NO_UPDATE=1 will skip updating the app.

---

in the unlikely event of nothing happening, try installing wget or curl first...
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y wget curl
```

- it is safe to run the setup multiple time
- if tuoni is already installed, the oneliner will run `tuoni update` command instead - the Tuoni C2 will be restarted
